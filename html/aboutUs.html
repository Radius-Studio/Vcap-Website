                    We provide various types of production services and support. Please see the descriptions below to determine which service request makes the most sense for your needs. From the Remedy Force Self-Service page navigate to "Video Services" then choose one of the following (you will be redirected to Drexel Connect for login first):
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Event Streaming or Archiving: This is our most common request. Use this request form is you would like to livestream your class, event, meeting or workshop that is scheduled on campus (University City) to our YouTube channel or if you would like a camera-only archived recording of an event to watch at a later date. This type of request requires at least 30 minutes on-site for setup prior to the start time of the event, access to an electrical outlet and a clear line of sight to the activity you would like recorded. Finished videos will be uploaded to your Drexel Streams account (preferred), our YouTube or Vimeo channels, or OneDrive. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Audio or Video Production: This is less common, more labor intensive and has a longer turnaround time. This is a full audio or video production, typically a high-definition (1080p or 4K), scripted or conversational "talking head" video. These are recorded in-studio with full production setup: lighting, backdrop, teleprompter, or a studio-recorded audio podcast, both of which require extensive editing. These requests generally require a short pre-production meeting to discuss the style and scope of the project and what you'd like to achieve with the content, as well as feasibility of our team to accommodate your request.

                    We operate on a first come, first served basis. We cannot guarantee that all requests will be accepted, however requests submitted five or more business days in advance are more likely to be fulfilled, based on availability of both resources and staff. Please visit the Remedy Force service center to request a video archive or livestream, video conferencing support, podcast recording or studio/location production. We are not authorized to reserve space in Korman or other on-campus locations.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Description: Audio and video class, meeting and event recordings that take place on the University City campus using a camcorder only. Includes trimming excess footage from the beginning and end of a presentation as needed and uploading it to the service of your choice (Drexel Streams, YouTube, Vimeo or OneDrive). No other post production is included in this service. Some events outside of Korman may meet this criteria. Please consult with us prior to your capture. Unedited archives that meet this criteria are generally available same-day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Turnaround Time: 1-2 Business Days

                    <br />
                    Description: Class, meeting or event recording that includes slides or some other form of computer content, plus video (split screen, PiP or cutting between two sources). Post production includes: cuts, transitions, slide insertion, audio correction, graphics (text-only) and publishing/compression of various media types.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Turnaround Time: 5 Business Days (72 hrs)
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    High Quality Multi-Camera Shoot*
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Description: On-location or in studio, high quality (HD and/or 4K) video capture requiring an advanced setup, such as a two-camera setup with live video switching, audio mixing, and heavy post production. A pre-production meeting is required for studio shoots as well as an on-site walkthrough and consultation for location shoots*.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Turnaround Time: Dependent on the scope of the project. Industry standard is 1 full hour of post production for one completed minute of video. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    *because location shoots include additional lighting, audio, teleprompter and more labor-intensive equipment setups these should not be confused with archive recordings of events or classes.
