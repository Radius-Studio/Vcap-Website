                    We provide various types of production services and support. Please see the descriptions below to determine which service request makes the most sense for your needs. From the Remedy Force Self-Service page navigate to "Video Services" then choose one of the following (you will be redirected to Drexel Connect for login first):
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Event Streaming or Archiving: This is our most common request. Use this request form is you would like to livestream your class, event, meeting or workshop that is scheduled on campus (University City) to our YouTube channel or if you would like a camera-only archived recording of an event to watch at a later date. This type of request requires at least 30 minutes on-site for setup prior to the start time of the event, access to an electrical outlet and a clear line of sight to the activity you would like recorded. Finished videos will be uploaded to your Drexel Streams account (preferred), our YouTube or Vimeo channels, or OneDrive. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Audio or Video Production: This is less common, more labor intensive and has a longer turnaround time. This is a full audio or video production, typically a high-definition (1080p or 4K), scripted or conversational "talking head" video. These are recorded in-studio with full production setup: lighting, backdrop, teleprompter, or a studio-recorded audio podcast, both of which require extensive editing. These requests generally require a short pre-production meeting to discuss the style and scope of the project and what you'd like to achieve with the content, as well as feasibility of our team to accommodate your request.

                    High Quality Multi-Camera Shoot*
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Description: On-location or in studio, high quality (HD and/or 4K) video capture requiring an advanced setup, such as a two-camera setup with live video switching, audio mixing, and heavy post production. A pre-production meeting is required for studio shoots as well as an on-site walkthrough and consultation for location shoots*.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Turnaround Time: Dependent on the scope of the project. Industry standard is 1 full hour of post production for one completed minute of video. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    *because location shoots include additional lighting, audio, teleprompter and more labor-intensive equipment setups these should not be confused with archive recordings of events or classes.
